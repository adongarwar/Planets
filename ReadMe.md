1)  A planet list API providing a list in which each object contains Planet name and url would be nice as first screen needs to display only list of names.
2)  By Selecting each row, we will push to planet detail screen and pass planet url so that Detail view and its view model will take care of fetching planet details using URLâ€™s like "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1/"
3)  Pagination can be easily implemented on the Planet list as total number of available records are being returned via response json.
4)  Features like presenting list of People  and Films from the Planet Detail view can be developed. Further from each character detail view, we can push list of starships, vehicles and films.
